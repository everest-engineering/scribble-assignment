# Feature Specification: First Round Setup

**Feature Branch**: `002-first-round-setup`

**Created**: 2026-06-17

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Given a game is starting and player names are trimmed (empty/whitespace-only rejected with a message), When the first round begins, Then the host (or first player) becomes the clearly-identified drawer, and the secret word (deterministically selected from the starter list) is visible only to the drawer."

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-06-17

- Q: How does the drawer securely retrieve the secret word? → A: The room snapshot API conditionally includes the `secretWord` field only when the requesting `participantId` matches the current `drawerId`. Non-drawers receive the snapshot without the word.
- Q: What UI treatment identifies the drawer on-screen? → A: A "Drawer" badge next to the player's name in the player list, visible to all players, reusing the existing badge pattern.
- Q: What are the official role names? → A: "drawer" and "guesser" are the two canonical roles. All occurrences of "non-drawer" and "guest" are replaced with "guesser".

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Player Name Trimming and Validation (Priority: P1)

Players should have clean display names. Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from submitted names, and names that are empty or whitespace-only after trimming are rejected with a clear message.

**Why this priority**: This prevents confusing display names that look empty or have odd spacing, ensuring the lobby player list is readable. It also closes a validation gap from the room setup flow.

**Independent Test**: Open the app, create a room with a name like "  Alice  " and verify the lobby shows "Alice". Then try to create a room with a name of just spaces and verify an error message is shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a player enters a name with leading or trailing spaces, **When** they submit the create or join form, **Then** the name is trimmed and the player appears in the lobby with the clean name.
2. **Given** a player enters a name that is empty or contains only whitespace, **When** they submit the create or join form, **Then** they see a clear error message and remain on the form.

### User Story 2 - First Round Begins with Drawer and Secret Word (Priority: P1)

When the host starts the game, a first round begins. The host is assigned as the drawer for this round. A secret word is deterministically selected from the starter word list and is revealed only to the drawer. Guessers see the game view but not the word. The drawer is identified by a "Drawer" badge in the player list visible to all players.

**Why this priority**: This is the core transition from lobby to gameplay. Without it, no game can proceed past the lobby.

**Independent Test**: Create a room with two players (Tab A host, Tab B guest). Host clicks Start Game. Tab A shows the word and a "Drawer" badge. Tab B shows the game view but no word. Both tabs show the host identified by a "Drawer" badge in the player list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the host starts a game with 2 or more players in the lobby, **When** the game transitions, **Then** the host is designated as the drawer for the first round.
2. **Given** the first round has started, **When** the drawer views the game screen, **Then** they see the secret word displayed as a large centered heading.
3. **Given** the first round has started, **When** a guesser views the game screen, **Then** they do not see the secret word.
4. **Given** the same room and round, **When** the word is requested, **Then** the same word is always returned (deterministic selection).
5. **Given** the first round has started, **When** any player views the game screen, **Then** they can see who the current drawer is.

### Edge Cases

- EC-01: Player name is only whitespace (spaces, tabs) → rejected with "Player name is required"
- EC-02: Player name has mixed leading/trailing whitespace → trimmed to the non-whitespace portion
- EC-03: Room has exactly 2 players at start → host is drawer, other player is guesser
- EC-04: Room has 8 players at start → host is drawer, all others are guessers
- EC-05: Drawer's tab is refreshed → drawer still sees the word on reconnection
- EC-06: Guesser tries to access the word via API → request returns without exposing the word

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST trim leading and trailing whitespace from player names submitted via create or join.
- **FR-002**: System MUST reject player names that are empty or whitespace-only after trimming with a clear error message.
- **FR-003**: When the host starts the game, the system MUST assign the host as the drawer for the first round.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST select a secret word deterministically from the starter word list when the first round begins.
- **FR-005**: The secret word MUST be visible only to the drawer.
- **FR-006**: Non-drawer players MUST NOT be able to see or infer the secret word through any API response.
- **FR-007**: All players MUST be able to see who the current drawer is.
- **FR-008**: The drawer MUST be able to see the secret word on the game screen.
- **FR-009**: The game state snapshot API MUST include the `secretWord` field only when the requesting participant is the current drawer. Non-drawers MUST receive the snapshot without the word.
- **FR-010**: The drawer MUST be identified by a "Drawer" badge next to their name in the player list, visible to all players.
- **FR-011**: The game state MUST persist across page refreshes — if the drawer refreshes their browser, they still see the word.

### Data Requirements *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Room**: { code, hostId, participants, status, currentRound, drawerId, secretWord }
- **Round**: { number, drawerId, word, status }
- **GameSnapshot**: { code, status, drawerId, participants, roundNumber, secretWord? } — `secretWord` is present only when the requesting participant is the drawer.

### Non-goals

- Drawing canvas or guess input UI (separate feature)
- Round progression, timer, or scoring
- Word hints or categories
- Multiple simultaneous rounds
- Word selection customization by host

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Player names with leading/trailing whitespace are displayed trimmed in the lobby within 1 second of submission.
- **SC-002**: Whitespace-only names are rejected with an error message within 1 second of submission.
- **SC-003**: After the host starts the game, all players see the game screen with the correct drawer identified within 2 seconds (1 polling cycle at 2s interval).
- **SC-004**: The drawer sees the secret word on their screen within 1 second of the game transitioning.
- **SC-005**: Non-drawers never see the word under any condition, verified by testing direct API access.
- **SC-006**: The word selection is deterministic — querying the word for a given room always returns the same result, verified through repeatable testing.

## Assumptions

- The starter word list already exists and is accessible server-side
- The existing polling mechanism (2s interval) is used for game state updates
- Players have stable internet connectivity
- The host is always the first drawer; drawer rotation will be handled in a future feature
- Room code is used as the seed for deterministic word selection (same room code always produces the same word for the first round)
- The existing lobby-to-game transition (status change to "playing") is already implemented
